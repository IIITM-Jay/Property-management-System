# Property Management System with multiple layers [Django] (Full-Stack)
The project dealt with managing different layers of property on the basis of different parameters they acquire and can support with the facilities they accomplish, in order to ease with the searching and booking operations. The project is implemented using django due to its various incorporated features that includes a gist describing the creation of applications from underlying concepts to implementation without taking much time.

## Features
* The system has been designed to maintain the classic three layered architecture of the fundamental DBMS model.
* This model helps to keep the consistency among the flow sequence of the data within different layers. 
* The developed system has also focused on the authentication and authorization on the numerous tasks involved by differenet layered parties. 
* The users will have their own dashboards to keep a check on various properties they have booked and be able to track the operations performed so far. 
* The overall sytem is so developed to enhance the simplicity while managing the properties from both the prespectives i.e., from admin and maintainers point of view as well as from the real world users.
